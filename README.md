# Task Printer

A simple, user-friendly Flask web app for Raspberry Pi that lets you enter tasks via a web interface and prints each task on a USB, network, or serial-connected receipt printer (e.g., Epson TM-T20III). Designed for easy setup and use by anyone.

Recent frontend refactor: the dynamic form UI is now driven by small Jinja form macros and a single static JS module. Form submissions include a compact JSON payload (plus multipart files) to make the backend simpler and more reliable.

**Inspired by and functionally based on [Laurie Hérault's article: "A receipt printer cured my procrastination"](https://www.laurieherault.com/articles/a-thermal-receipt-printer-cured-my-procrastination). Their code was not public, so this open-source version was created for the community.**

## Features
- Web interface for entering and organizing tasks
- Each task prints as a separate receipt with clear formatting
- Supports USB, network, and serial receipt printers (via python-escpos)
- Dynamic task and subtitle sections
  - Per‑print tear‑off mode (optional delay between tasks, no cut)
- Frontend powered by:
  - Jinja form macros for reusable UI (icon picker, flair row, task row)
  - A single static module `static/js/app.js` for add/remove rows, flair toggles, job polling, image preview, save-as-template, and prefill
  - Cleaner form submission: a hidden `payload_json` field carries sections/tasks as JSON; image files stay in the multipart body and are referenced by field name
- Dark mode and responsive design
- Easy first-run setup and reconfiguration via web UI
- Systemd service for auto-start on boot
- Works for any user and install location

## Requirements
- Raspberry Pi (or any Linux system)
- Python 3.7+
- A compatible receipt printer (USB, network, or serial)
- [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) dependencies:
  - Flask
  - python-escpos
  - Pillow
  - pyusb

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/belu1357/task-printer.git
   cd task-printer
   ```
2. **Install Python dependencies system-wide:**
   ```bash
  sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  - Fedora helper: `./scripts/setup_fedora.sh --yes` will install system packages (including emoji fonts) and set up a venv with requirements.
3. **Plug in your receipt printer:**
   - For USB: Connect the printer to your Raspberry Pi via USB.
   - For network: Ensure the printer is on the same network and you know its IP address.
   - For serial: Connect the serial cable and note the port (e.g., /dev/ttyUSB0).
4. **(Optional) Add your user to the printer group for USB access:**
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG lp $(whoami)
   # or, for some printers:
   sudo usermod -aG plugdev $(whoami)
   ```
   Then reboot or log out/in.

## Running the App
1. **Start the app manually:**
   ```bash
   # quickest
   python3 app.py
   # or use the helper which can leverage uv/venv if configured
   ./start.sh
   ```
2. **Access the web interface:**
   - On the Pi: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
   - On your network: http://(raspberry-pi-ip):5000

## First-Time Setup
- On first run, you'll be guided through a web-based setup page to select your printer type, connection, and preferences.
- The app auto-detects USB printers and helps you enter network/serial details if needed.
- You can always revisit the setup page via the ⚙️ Settings button.

## Using the Web Interface
- Add tasks and optional subtitles using the dynamic form.
- Click **Print Tasks** to print each task as a separate receipt.
 - Optional: set a “Tear‑off delay (seconds)” to wait between tasks and disable cutting for that print. Leave blank/0 for default behavior.
- Use the ⚙️ **Settings** button to reconfigure your printer or preferences at any time.
 - Toggle dark mode for easier viewing.
 - Check recent print jobs and status via the **🧾 Jobs** page.

## Health Check

- The endpoint `GET /healthz` returns JSON with app and printer status (worker started/alive, queue size, config presence, and basic printer reachability).

## Auto-Start on Boot (systemd)
1. **Install the systemd service:**
   ```bash
   sudo ./install_service.sh
   ```
   This script will auto-detect your user and install location—no editing required.
2. **Check the service status:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status taskprinter.service
   ```
3. **View logs:**
   ```bash
   journalctl -u taskprinter.service -f
   ```

## Troubleshooting
- **Printer not found:**
  - For USB, ensure your user is in the correct group (`lp` or `plugdev`).
  - For network, double-check the IP and port.
  - For serial, verify the port and baudrate.
- **Permissions:**
  - If you see permission errors, try rebooting after adding your user to the printer group.
- **Service not starting:**
  - Check logs with `journalctl -u taskprinter.service -f`.
- **Web UI not loading:**
  - Ensure Python dependencies are installed and the service is running.

## Stopping the Application

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the application is running. 

## Configuration

- Global default tear‑off delay: set `default_tear_delay_seconds` in `config.json` (0–60). When set, template prints use this value by default and the Index page preloads it into the tear‑off input. Users can override it per print.
- Frontend JSON payload:
  - On submit, the index form adds a hidden input `payload_json` containing `{ sections: [...] }`, where each section has `subtitle` and an array of `tasks`.
  - Each task may include flair: `{ flair_type: "none" | "icon" | "image" | "qr" | "emoji", flair_value: string | null }`.
  - For image flair, `flair_value` is the file input field name (e.g., `flair_image_2_3`); the actual file is sent in the multipart form under that name.
- Backend parsing:
  - The server now prefers `payload_json` and falls back to legacy dynamic field names (e.g., `task_1_2`) for backward compatibility.
  - Server-side validation enforces section/task limits, text/QR length, total character limits, and rejects control characters.
  - Emoji flair uses a monochrome emoji font for rasterization when configured.

### Emoji Rendering

- For reliable emoji on thermal printers, use a monochrome emoji font.
- Recommended fonts: Noto Emoji (monochrome), OpenMoji-Black, or Symbola.
- Set via either:
  - Config `emoji_font_path` (Setup page → Fonts), or
  - Env var `TASKPRINTER_EMOJI_FONT_PATH`.
- If no emoji font is provided, the app attempts to auto-detect common paths. A basic substitution (e.g., ✅ → ✔) is applied for popular symbols to improve out-of-the-box results, but a proper font is preferred.
